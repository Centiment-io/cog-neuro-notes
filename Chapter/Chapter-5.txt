###Chapter 5
#####Sensation and Perception

---

- Perception begins with a stimulus from the environment which stimulates one of the sense organs.
- This input is transduced into neural activity by the sense organ and sent to the brain for processing
- Sensation refers to the early processing
- Percept: mental representation of the original stimulus
- Perception: the process of constructing a percept
- Senses: physiological capacities to provide input from the environment to out neurological system
- Extensive interaction takes place between the sensory modalities much earlier in the processing pathways than the  previously imagined

####Shared Processing from Acquisition to Anatomy
- Each system begins with some sort of anatomical structure for collecting, filtering, and amplifying information from the environment
- Each system has specialized receptor cells that transduce the environmental stimulus into neural signals
- The olfactory nerve is a bit rogue. It is the shortest cranial nerve and follows a different course. It terminates in the olfactory bulb, and axons extending from here course directly to the primary and secondary olfactory cortices without going through the brainstem or thalamus

####Receptors Share Responses to Stimuli
- Range
- Adaptation: the adjusting of the sensitivity of the sensory system to the current environment and to important changes in the environment.
- Acuity: how good we are at distinguishing among stimuli within a sensory modality
	- If a sensory system devotes more receptors to certain types of information, there is a corresponding increase in cortical representation of that information

####Connective Similarities
- Visual: Lateral Geniculate Nucleus
- Auditory: Medial Geniculate Nucleus
- Somatic: Ventral posterior nuclear complex
- Gustatory: Ventral posteromedial nucleus
- Not only there are projections from these nuclei to the cortex, but the thalamic nuclei are interconnected, providing an opportunity for **multisensory integration**

####Audition
- Signal transduction from sound wave to neuronal signal begins at the **eardrums**
- Sound waves disturb the **hair cells**
- The **mechanical input** is transformed into a neural output at the **cochlea**
- Signals are processed in the **hair cells** and basilar membrane of the **cochlea**
- The **cochlea** sends its information un the form of neuronal signals to the **inferior colliculus** and the **cochlear nucleus**
- Information travels to the **medial geniculate nucleus** of the **thalamus** and on to the **primary auditory cortex**
- Neurons throughout the auditory pathway maintain their **tonotopic** arrangement as they travel up to the cortex, but the tight organization is less apparent in the auditory cortices A1 and A2 when viewed with high-resolution methods
- Sound localization is aided by the processing of differences in interaural time and interaural sound intensity, which are each coded separately in the brain

####Olfaction
- Signal transduction from odorant to neuronal signal begins when the **odorant** attaches to an **odor receptor** in the **olfactory epithelium**
- The signal is then sent to the **olfactory bulb** through the **olfactory nerve**, which projects to the **primary olfactory cortex** (pyriform), located at the ventral junction of the frontal and temporal cortices
- Signals are also relaxed to the **orbitofrontal cortex**, a secondary olfactory processing area
- **Primary olfactory cortex**: detects changes in external odor
- **Secondary olfactory cortex**: identifies the smell itself
- We use our two nostrils to obtain different olfactory samples, varying the rate of airflow through each nostril and thus altering the rate of absorption
- The olfactory pathway is the only sensory pathway that does not send information to the thalamus

####Gustation
- Gustation and olfaction are known together as the **chemical senses** because the initial response is to molecules (chemicals) in the environment
- Five basic tastes: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami
- Perception of more complex tastes arises from the complex cortical processing of these individual tastes in areas of the brain such as the **secondary gustatory cortex** in the **orbitofrontal region**
- Signal transduction is initiated when a **taste cell** in the mouth responds to a **tastant** by depolarizing and sends a signal to the **gustatory nucleus**in the **dorsal medulla**
- From there, a signal zips to the **ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus** of the **thalamus**
- The VPM synapses with the primary gustatory cortex found in the **operculum** and **insula**
- The **primary gustatory cortex** connects with the **secondary processing areas** found in the **orbitofrontal cortex**
- The **orbitofrontal cortex**: involved in processing the reward value of food and the resulting motivation to eat food

####Somatosensation
- **Corpuscles** located in the skin respond to somatosensory touch information
- **Nociceptors** (free nerve endings) respond to pain and temperature information
- Nerve cells at the junctions of muscles and tendons provide **proprioceptive** information
- Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contains a **homunculus** of the body, wherein the more sensitive regions encompass relative larger areas of the cortex
- Somatosensory representations exhibit **plasticity**, showing variation in extend and organization as a function of individual experience

####Vision
- Light activates the photoreceptors, the rods and cones, on the retina
- The optic nerve is formed from the axons of the ganglion cells, some of which decussate at the optic chiasm
- Axons in the optic nerve synapse on the LGN, and from the LGN become the optic radiations that are sent to V1
- Ten percent of the fibers from the retina innervate non-LGN subcortical structures, including the pulvinar and superior colliculus

#####Retinotopic Maps
- Receptive field of a cell: visual neurons respond only to a stimulus that is presented in a specific region of space
- Visual cells form an orderly mapping between spatial location and the neural representation of that dimension
- In vision, these topographic representations are referred to as **retinotopic maps**

#####Cortical Visual Areas
- The visual cortex is made up of many distinct regions
- These regions are defined by their distinct, retinotopic maps
- Visual areas have functional differences that reflect the types of computations performed by cells within the areas
- For instance, V4 is sensitive to color and V5 to motion
- Humans also have visual areas that do not correspond to any region in our close primate relatives

#####From Sensation to Perception
- Our percepts are more closely related to activity in higher visual areas than to activity in primary visual cortex
- Anatomical differences among people in the size of V1 affect the extent of visual illusion

#####Deficits in Visual Perception
- Superior colliculus lesions impair the ability of an animal to orient toward the position of a stimulus (important for spatial orientation)
- Visual cortex lesions impair visual acuity (important for object identification)
- Achromatopsia: inability to perceive color
	- Lesions to areas in and around human V4
	- Also important for shape perception; color is one attribute that facilitates shape perception
- Akinetopsia: inability to process motion
	- Lesions to area V5 (human MT)
	- As with many neurological conditions, the deficit can be quite subtle for unilateral lesions

####Multimodal Processing in the Brain
- Some areas of the brain, such as the **superior colliculus** and **superior temporal sulci**, process information from more than one sensory modality, integrating the multimodal information to increase the sensitivity and accuracy of perception
- When multisensory information is presented coincidently in time and space, the multisensory neural response is enhanced
- The reverse is also true; when multisensory information is not presented coincidently in time and space, the multisensory neural response is depressed

####Synesthesia
- People with synesthesia experience a mixing of the senses
	- e.g., colores hearing, colores graphemes, or colored taste
- Synesthesia is associated with both abnormal activation patterns in functional imaging studies and abnormal patterns of connectivity in structural imaging studies

####Perceptual Reorganization
- Following sensory deprivation, the function of sensory regions of the cortex may become reorganized, or exhibit what is called plasticity
- For instance, in blind individuals, areas of the brain that are usually involved in visual function may become part of the somatosensory cortex
- Plasticity can also be observed in healthy individuals if they are deprived of information from one sensory modality for even relatively short period of time
