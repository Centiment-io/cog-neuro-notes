###Lecture 25

####Classification, identification and reconstruction
- Stimulus representation
	- Pixel luminance
	- Local contrast
	- Object categories
	- Grating orientations
	- Semantics
- Type of brain activity
	- Neurons
	- Voxels
- Domains of decoding
	- Perceptual decoding
	- Cognitive decoding
	- Motor decoding (opposite of perceptual)
- Types of decoding
	- Classification
		- Object class to which individual exemplars may belong
	- Identification
		- Decoding very specific face
	- Reconstruction

####Encoding vs decoding
Encoding and decoding are scientifically equivalent EXCEPT that you cannot estimate the noise ceiling for a decoder

---

####Encoding, decoding and optimization
- The encoding model
- The decoding model
	- Platonic ideal cause we don't know the perfect encoder
- Optimization/estimation

####Decoding: Identification
- Very precise symmetry between identification and reconstruction

####Importance of the prior
Prior that is a 1/f distribution of Gabor functions (sparse Gabor prior)

####Models can be combined to improve decoding
- Different brain areas represent different things
- Decode only from PVC very bad (structural model)
- Decode from PVC image edges, and then higher areas for semantic (semantic + structural)

####Motion-energy decoding (early vision)
- Direct decoding: bad
- Prior: 5000 of natural video 
- MAP: highest probability video clip
- AHP: average high posterior

####LDA scene decoding (higher vision)
- Used in NLP
- Method for finding the intrinsic topic structure, knowing nothing about the content
- Use the same for natural images: label all the objects in the images

####Decoding and reconstructing visual imagery
- 

####Questions
- Do you think consciousness is an emerging property of the structure of the brain
- Is your validation set of size 1
