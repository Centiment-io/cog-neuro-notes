####Correlations w/PCC seed during resting fixation
- **Default Mode Network (DMN)**: is a network of brain regions that are active when the individual is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest
- fMRI BOLD signals: because BOLD is measuring blood flow, then correlation may be influenced by the fact that they share blood supply

####Resting state and the default mode network
- Meta-analysis of PET data during resting state 132 participants
- Not-susceptible to blood flow
- Temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) + PFC //elaborate
	- Components
		- Medial temporal lobe: memory
		- Medial prefrontal cortex: theory of mind
		- Posterior cingulate cortex: integration
		- Adjacent ventral precuneus and the medial lateral and inferior parietal cortex

####Regions associated with the default network
- vMPFC
- PCC/Rsp
- IPL
- LTC
- dMPFC
- HF+

####Different sorts of 'resting' states
- Normal wakefulness
- Hypnotic state
- Anesthesia

####People with autism show more default network activity

####Resting state and patient populations
- VS/UWS: vegetative state / unresponsive wakefulness syndrome
- Locked-in syndrome patient: has default network

####The default network and task-related decreases in BOLD
- Resting state correlations in Bold
- Task-related decreases in BOLD
- Really slow (.1 Hz)

####People who daydream show more default network activity

####The default network appears to be activated in some sorts of behavioral and cognitive tasks
- Autobiographical memory
- Theory of mind
	- Predict the mental state of others
- Envisioning the future
- Moral decision making

####Narrative comprehension & semantic selectivity
- Regions of the brain that are more selective for semantic concepts in this task (passive listening) happens to correlate quite highly with the default network
- PFC, LP, Posterior Precuneus
- All of the above encompass the DMN
- Overlap between semantic and default network

####Semantic tuning shifts during visual search
- Two principal components: humans and vehicles
- Red: shifting toward target
- Blue: shifting away from target
	- Regions of the cortex identified in DMN

####DMN: inner speech?
Resting state network consists of regions of the brain that 
These regions of cortex in the DMN tend to be deactivated when doing a visual spatial attention task
Default areas overlap with the semantic network and are the parts that show more semantic selectivity when doing a story attention task (and also internal speech)

####The default network as a collection of subnets
- The medial temporal lobe subsystems **provides** 
	- information from prior experiences in the form of memories and 
	- associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation
- The medial prefrontal subsystem **facilitates** the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations
- These two subsystems **converge** on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex
- The default network may be involved in exploiting past experiences to plan for the future, navigating social interactions, and ruminating when not performing tasks
