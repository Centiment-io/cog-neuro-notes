####EEG: Electroencephalography
- Advantages
	- Relatively simple and cheap
	- Good temporal resolution
	- Measures neural activity
	- Inherently 2D
- Disadvantages
	- Poor signal quality
	- Poor spatial resolution (> 1cm)
	- Neural activity measure is biased
	- Distortion contaminates and signals

**Inverse problem**: go from 2D to 3D

####ECoG: Electrocorticography
- Advantages
	- Relatively good signal quality
	- Good temporal resolution
	- Measures neural activity
	- Inherently 2D
- Disadvantages
	- Invasive, requires craniotomy
	- Currently old recording technology
	- Neural activity measure is biased
	- Patients often do not perform well

####MEG: Magnetoencephalography
- Advantages
	- Better signal quality than EEG
	- Good temporal resolution
	- Measures neural activity
	- Inherently 2D
- Disadvantages
	- Expensive
	- Poor spatial resolution (~8mm?)
	- Neural activity measure is biased

####PET: Positron Emission Tomography
- Advantages
	- Relatively simple and cheap
	- Good temporal resolution
	- Tomographic (2D slice)
- Disadvantages
	- Poor signal quality
	- Poor spatial resolution (> 1cm)
	- Probably really bad for you

####fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Advantages
	- Good spatial resolution (~3mm)
	- Inherently 3D
	- In continuous development
- Disadvantages
	- Very expensive & complicated
	- Poor temporal resolution (>1s)
	- Does not measure neural activity

dMRI: Diffusion imaging tracks water (along axons)

####NIRS: Near-infrared spectroscopy
- Advantages
	- Cheaper than fMRI
	- Portable
- Disadvantages
	- Poor signal quality
	- Bad spatial resolution (>2cm?)
	- Doesn't measure neural activity
	- Inherently 2D

####NIRS-DOT: Diffuse Optical Tomography
- Advantages
	- Better spatial resolution than NIRS
	- Tomographic (recovers 3D)
- Disadvantages
	- Poor signal quality
	- Poor spatial resolution (>8mm?)
	- Expensive, complicated

####TMS: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
- Advantages
	- Not merely correlational
	- Relatively cheap
- Disadvantages
	- Like being hit with a hammer
	- Bad spatial resolution (>3cm)
	- Inherently 2D
	- Difficult to localize

####Behavior
- Advantages
	- Measures what we want to explain
	- Relatively cheap and easy
	- **Low-tech**
- Disadvantages
	- Low bandwidth
	- Interpretation usually ambiguous
	- Difficult to identify mechanism
	- Operational definitions are poor
