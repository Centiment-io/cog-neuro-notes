###Lecture 14

####Anatomical organization of the motor system
- Premotor and supplementary motor cortex regions
	- Learning?
	- Integrating motor & other systems
- Cerebellum
	- Integration of feedback
	- Timing of motor movements
	- Learning
- Basal ganglia
	- Selection/initiation of actions
- Motor cortex
	- Planning motor cortex
- Brainstem
- Spinal cord
	- Reflex arc
	- Rhythmic movements

####Pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts
- The brain innervates the spinal cord via the pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts
- The pyramidal tract is also called the corticospinal tract

####Basal ganglia and cerebellum
- The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are two prominent subcortical components of the motor pathways

####Cerebellum
- Motor execution
- Motor planning
- Balance and eye movements
- Not well imaged structure
- Ipsilateral control

####Basal ganglia
- The basal ganglia consists of 5 motor-related nuclei
	- Striatum (Caudate & Putamen)
	- Globus pallidus
	- Substantia Nigra
		- Parkinson's
		- Dopaminergic neurons
	- Subthalmic nucleus
	- The basal ganglia appear to act in opposition to cortex

####Motor-related areas of cortex
- Motor cortex: Planning, control & ec

####Functional organization of the motor system
- The motor system is composed of many, anatomically distributed components
- Some of these components are cortical, many are subcortical
- The distributed components operate hierarchically and in parallel

####The endpoint selection hypothesis of movement control
- One of the classic questions in motor system is **what the heck is motor cortex doing? What information is represented in motor cortex?**
- Seems unlikely there is a linear relationship between motor cortex and muscle movements
- One theory: motor goal, not how to achieve motor goal

####Disorders of the motor system
- Spinal cord
	- Paraplegic: paralysis of lower limbs
	- Quadraplegic: paralysis of all limbs
- Motor cortex
	- Hemiplegia: paralysis of contralateral limbs
	- Hemiparesis: weakness or impaired control of contralateral limbs
- Secondary/association motor areas
	- Apraxia: loss of ability to generate coordinated actions, but not due to loss of muscle control
	- Ideomotor: difficulty in carrying out motor commands and sequential actions
	- Ideational: loss of knowledge about actions
- Parkinson's (substantia nigra): Resting tremor and loss of fine motor movements
- Cerebellum
	- Ataxia: poor coordination of distal limb movements and poor use of motor feedback
	- More diffuse impairment of cognitive functions: timing, number related functions

####Effects of corpus callosum resection
- People with normal connected hemispheres have a very hard time drawing perpendicular axis
- People with callosotomy are really good at this

####Parkinson's disease
- Parkinson's is caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
