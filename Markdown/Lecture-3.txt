####The neuron doctrine
- The gross anatomy of the brain was well understood by 1850. However, it was not known whether this anatomy reflected a complex tangle of continuous wires, or some unknown scheme
- Camilo Golgi (1873) developed a revolutionary staining method that revealed individual neurons. He believed that neurons were coupled directly
- Ramon y Cajal (1888) carried out extensive microanatomical analysis and formulated the cell doctrine for neurons
- Charles Sherrington (1897) developed the idea of specialized synapses that transmit signals from one neuron to another

#####Neurons come in many shapes and sizes
- Purkinjie
- Granule
- Motor
- Pyramidal
- Chandelier
- Spindle
- Stellate
- Tripolar

#####Cell body & dendrites of a vertebrate neuron
- Dendrites have spines (little bumps)

#####The resting pontential
- An electrochemical equilibrium
- The resting potential is about -60-70 mv

-- | Sodium (Na^+) | Potassium (K^+) | Chloride (Cl^-)
--- | --- | --- | ---
Inside | Low | High | Low
Outside | High | Low | High

1. Open K^+ channels create the resting potential
	- Open K^+ channel
	- Closed Na^+ channel
2. Some Na^+ channels open, depolarizing the cell to threshold
	- Open Na^+ channel
	- Closed K^+ channel
3. At threshold, additional voltage-gated Na^+ channels open, causing a rapid change of polarity - the action potential
4. Na^+ channels are inactivated; gated K^+ channels open, re-polarizing and even hyper-polarizing the cell (undershoot phase)
	- Inactivated Na6+ channels
	- Open K^+ channel
5. All gated channels close. The cell returns to its resting potential

####Neuronal Circuits

- Mammalian neocortex has ~6 layers of neurons (between 1-4mm)
	- Superficial
	- Upper
	- Middle
	- Deep
- Cortex is also organized in columns
- White mater makes connections between areas
	- Several long tracts
	- Short tracts
	- Long projection fibers
- Brain connections influence brain folding
	- Wires act as springs pulling areas together to reduce length of wires
	- During development they pull together
		- Cortex at the two sides of a gyrus have similar tasks
		- Cortex at opposite sides of sulcus probably don't have related tasks
- Cortical input and output is systematic
	- Layer for is the recipient layer (receives input from the thalamus)
- The brain is hierarchical, parallel network
