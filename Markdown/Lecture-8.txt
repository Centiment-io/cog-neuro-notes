###Lecture 8

####The auditory pathway
- Auditory nerve
- Cochlear nuclei
- Superior olivary nucleus
- Inferior colliculus
- Medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
- Primary auditory cortex

####Primary visual cortex forms a retinotopic map
- Retinotopic map in macaque C1 using radioactive trace (Tootel et al., 1988)

####MRI can recover retinotopic maps
- Retinotopic map in Human V1-V3 using functional MRI (Sereno et al., 1995)
- Left visual field is represented in the right hemisphere and vice versa
- Top visual field is represented in the bottom hemisphere and vice versa

####Other maps in primary visual cortex
- Ocular dominance map
- Orientation map
- Spatial Frequency
	- Size
- Wavelength
	- Color
- Temporal frequency
	- How fast
- Direction

####Single neurons reflect their position in maps

####Many dimensions are coded at each position
- Layer 4: input layer
	- Segregated by eye
- Hypercolumn
- Blobs: columns selective by color
	- Low spatial frequency: big things
- Orientation columns surround blobs

####Maps are organized both globally and locally
