###Lecture 26

####Decoding dreams
- fMRI activity pattern before awakening
- Machine learning decoder assisted by lexical and image databases
- Awakening index: different epics in which participants were waken up
- Every time a participant is waken up, they describe their dream
- For every possible semantic concept
	- True positive: not dreaming about a concept but I thought you were
	- False positive
	- Hit
	- Miss
- Cognitive and systems neuroscience: brain areas specialized to represent certain types of information
- AUC: accuracy
- Functional areas
	- PPA: Parahippocampal place area = Scenes
	- FFA: Fusiform face area = Humans
- Consistent with what you would expect with other studies when awake
- Provides way to determine if there is a systematic relationship between brain structures active when dreaming and description of dreaming
- How far back in time can we accurately predict what they were dreaming about compared to reported dreaming

####Limitations of motor BMI
- We don't know the true feature space
	- Train on actual movement
- Neurons adapt/change across days

####Dimensionalities for experiments
- Neural activity 85-91D
- Intrinsic manifold: 10D
- Kinematics: 2D

####A brain-machine interface for memory
- Ted Berger
	- First hippocampus decoder
- Nonlinear MIMO model
	- Multi input multi output

####How good your decoder
- How well you can measure
- How well you can model
- how fast
