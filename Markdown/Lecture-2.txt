####Introduction and Orienting

- The brain is organized at multiple scales
	- Neurons
	- Columns and Layers
	- Maps
	- Areas
- Numbers in the brain (rough estimates!)
	- \# of neurons in adult brain = 8x10^10 (80 billion)
	- \# of neurons in adult cerebral cortex = 1.8x10^10
	- \# of synapses on typical cortical neuron = 6x10^3
	- \# of cortical columns = 1x10^5
	- Average loss of cortical neurons = 1/second
	- Total surface area of cerebral cortex = 2.5x10^3 cm^3
	- Thickness of cerebral cortex = 1.5-4mm
	- \# of cortical areas = 400 (???)
- Brain size varies with body size
- The neuraxis of the human brain
	- Front = Anterior or Rostral
	- Back = Posterior or Caudal
	- Up = Dorsal
	- Down = Ventral
- Planes of transection for the human brain
	- Horizontal: up-down
	- Sagittal: left-right
	- Coronal: front-back

####Cortical anatomy and brain flattening

- Cerebral cortex versus cerebrum
	- **Cerebral Cortex**: The outermost later of gray matter making up the superficial aspect of the cerebrum
	- **Grey matter**: cell bodies
	- **White matter**: axons -> connects everything together
		- Several long tracts
		- Short tracts
		- Long projection fibers
- Korbinian Brodmann's map (52 areas)
- Dedicated sensory and motor areas & systems
	- Gustatory
	- Motor: Frontal cortex (near central sulcus)
	- Somatosensory: Parietal cortex (near central sulcus)
	- Olfactory
	- Auditory: Superior aspect of the temporal lobe (near the Sylvian fissue)
	- Visual: Occipital lobe
		- Primary visual cortex (V1)
		- Receives visual input from the Thalamus

#####Cortical areas involved in "higher cognition"
- Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
- Orbitofrontal cortex
- Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
