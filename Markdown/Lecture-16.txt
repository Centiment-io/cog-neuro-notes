####A brain-machine interface (BMI)
- Closed-loop system for taking brain activity and driving some sort of computer directly using brain activity
- Training using actual motor activity to correlate brain activity to it
- What brain structure to record from
- Andy Schwartz (CMU)

####Limitations of motor BMI
- Two big limitations
	- Electrodes don't last forever because they are not biocompatible (gliosis)
	- Neurons adapt/change across days
- Sadtler, Quick. Golub, Shase, Ryu, Tyler-Kabara, Yu & Batista, Nature, 2014

####Varieties of memory
- Assumed stages of memory processing
	- Encoding
	- Storage
	- Retrieval
- Memory
	- Sensory, short-term, working memory
		- Central executive
		- Visuospatial sketch pad
		- Phonological loop
	- Long-term memory
		- Declarative memory (explicit) -> Knowledge
			- Events (episodic memory)
				- Specific personal experiences from a particular time and place
			- Facts (semantic memory)
				- World knowledge, object knowledge, language knowledge, conceptual priming
		- Non-declarative memory (implicit) -> Experience
			- Procedural memory
				- Skills (motor and cognitive)
			- Perceptual representation system
				- Perceptual priming
			- Classical conditioning
				- Conditioned responses between two stimuli
			- Non-associative learning
				- Habituation, sensitization

####Medial temporal lobe system
- Fornix
- Anterior thalmic nucleus
- Mamillary body
- Medial prefrontal cortex
- Medial temporal lobe
- Hippocampus
- Perirhinal cortex
- Entorhinal cortex

####Connections to hippocampus
- Neocortical association areas
- Parahippocampal region
- Hippocampus

####Memory loss caused by cortical lesions
- Cerebral cortex
- Medial temporal lobe, hippocampus and surrounding structures
