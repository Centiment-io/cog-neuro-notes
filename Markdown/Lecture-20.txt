###Lecture 20

####Semantic ROIs from a functional localizer
- Subtract non-word from word activation

####Human semantic brain areas
- People have worked on semantics for the 100 years
- Prefrontal cortex (dorsal and ventral)
- Temporal lobe

####Representation of phonemic, syntactic & semantic features
- Problem: too much data
- Data compression: Principal components analysis
	- Simplex method of doing dimensionality reduction
	- Take eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix
	- Reconstruct lower-rank matrix from eigenvalues
	- Trick: gives you a bunch of eigenvectors that are orthogonal to each other
		- Orthonormal space
	- Some matrices are not compressible at all

####Subjects share ~5 semantic dimensions
- Y: amount of variance
- X: principle component number

####Words projected onto group PCs
- Low-dimensional component space
- Space that mediates between feature space (huge) and voxels across all of the brains
- Space that your brain uses to organize the world

####The first PC. concepts that increase BOLD
- Red: high loading of this word
- Neutral (Blue) activity: less activation
- Animacy vs. inanimacy

####Voxels projected onto group semantic PCs
- Red: PC1
- Green: PC2
- Blue: PC3

####Semantic areas in individual brains
- Looking at multiple subjects is a problem because brains vary
- Minor sulci are variable among individuals
- Some gyri only exists in 10% of the people
- Brain size correlates to body size

####Semantic areas in individual brains
- Localizer task: words and non-words
- Subtract them
- Temporal cortex

####Cross-subject volumetric alignment
- MNI: averaged brain crated by averaging a fuckload of brains
	- Sheer, scale, rotate
- One brain
- Reference brain to MNI brain
- Data loss!

####Cross-subject surface alignment
- Extract grey matter
- Inflate brain: brain-shaped ball

####PrAGMATiC
- Probabilistic and Generative Model of Areas Tiling Cortex
- Ball and spring model
- Pin springs to anatomy 
	- Major anatomical landmarks (optimal)
	- Functional localizers (the one Jack used)
- Algorithm choose areas to maximize predictions
- Remove functional areas that have no significant relationship to semantic information
- 77 individual semantically functional areas on the left size and 64 on the right
