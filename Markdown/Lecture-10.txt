###Lecture 10

####Visual areas can be grouped into "what and "where" streams"
- **Dorsal** [Parietal stream]: Where? 
	- Motion
	- Spatial relationships
- **Ventral** [Inferotemporal stream]: What? 
	- Form
	- Color

####Ventral stream areas at different levels of the hierarchy are thought to have different functions
	Luminance edges to Semantic categories
1. Retina
2. Thalamus (LGN)
3. Intermediate Visual Areas
	- V1, V2, V3, V4
	- Lateral Occipital Cortex
4. FFA (Fusiform Face Area)
5. EBA (Extrastriate Body Area) and PPA (Parahippocampal Place Area)

####Receptive field size grows across the visual hierarchy
- The further in the visual processing processes, the receptive fields cross each other and converge into a non lateralized representation

####Complexity of preferred shapes from across the visual hierarchy
- Neurons in intermediate visual aras prefer shapes of intermediate complexity

####Possible features that might be represented in intermediate human visual areas
1. Synthetic naturalistic movie (15Hz)
2. Ground truth
	- Object silhouettes
	- Surface normals
	- Depth
3. Feature spaces
	- Silhouette contours
	- Orientation discontinuities
	- Depth discontinuities
	- Medial axes
4. Discretize feature space into feature channels
	- Degree of curvature
	- Orientation
	- Location, scale
5. Complessive output nonlinearity (log)
6. Temporal downsample (15 to 1 Hz)

####The object silhouette model is best in V4/LO
- The object model is a semantic model (doesn't know about the shape)
- V4 likes the object silhouette, less the scene contours
- V4 likes the scene contour, less the object silhouette
- **V4 Image segmentation and grouping!**

####Neurons in inferior temporal cortex are selective for complex shape
- Selectivity for Faces and Persons
	- Orientation
	- View point
	- Posture
	- Direction of gaze

####Neurons in inferior temporal cortex are selective for complex shape
- Shape selective columns and slabs
- Sketchy
- Type 4 result: we want it to be true but we don't have enough evidence

####Higher-order human visual areas are selective for complex semantic categories

####A semantic category model for high-level vision
- Wordnet (1980s) by George Miller
- Hand-drawn tree of the isorelationships between all the nouns in the English language
- Indicator matrix
- Regression to find out how does the voxel response changes on the presence of a specific object

####Predictions of the motion-energy versus the semantic category models
- Motion-energy model predicts lower-order visual systems
- Semantic category model predicts higher-order visual systems
- Principal component analysis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis

####Object and action category maps
- **Blue**: indoor scenes
- **Pink**: vehicles and lots of motion
- **Red**: movement
- **Green**: People
- **Yellow**: animals
