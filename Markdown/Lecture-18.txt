####The features of language
#####Multi-scale representation of language
- Sound pressure wave
- Short-time frequency spectogram
	- A representation that has both time and frequency in it
- Phonemes & Articulatory features
- Syntax
	- Different parts of speech and what its order means (grammatical information)
- Semantics
	- Meaning
- Narrative

#####Sound pressure waveforms and spectrograms
- 

#####Phonetic (articulatory) features: What you say
- IPA: all the possible sounds that humans can make

#####Phonemic
- A subset of the phonetic features
- Some languages don't distinguish between l and r (asians?)

#####Syntactic (grammatical) features

#####Box models of production & comprehension

####Brain areas involved in language
- Auditory nerve
- Cochlear nuclei
- Superior olivary nucleus
- Inferior colliculus
- Medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
- Primary auditory cortex

#####The language system
- Broca's area
- Supramarginal gurys
- Angular gyrus
- Wernicke's area
- Superior temporal gyrus
- Inferior frontal cortex

####Brain lesions affecting language
- Global aphasia: fluent, severe perception and production deficits
- Broca's aphasia: fluent, speech output impaired, writing impaired, comprehension less affected
- Wernicke's aphasia: non-fluent, comprehension problems, reading impaired, spontaneous speech may be fluent (at least for articulation and prosody), grammar is preserved
- Anomia: non-fluent, deficit in naming and word finding, excellent comprehension and semantics
- Conduction aphasia (auditory cortex); non-fluent, auditory short term memory problem, reading deficit may bot be repesent
- Echolalia (auditory cortex): non-fluent

#####Broca's aphasia
- Production aphasia: patients know what they are trying to say, but they can't say it
- Broca's area
	- Pars opercularis
	- Pars triangularis

#####Wernicke's aphasia
- Sensory aphasia: patients don't know what they are trying to say and can't comprehend language

#####Lichtheim's (1880s) view of language processing

####Brain representation of spectral features
