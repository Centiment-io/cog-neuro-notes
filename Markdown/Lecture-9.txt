####The eye
- Evolution is stupid: photoreceptors are pointing in the wrong direction
- Light passes through the ganglion cells, middle layer and bounces to the back of the eye
- Wavelength sensitivity of cones and rods
	- Rods: 495 nm
	- Cones
		- Red: 560 nm
		- Green: 530 nm
		- Blue: 430 nm

####Both eyes project to both hemispheres
- Optic chiasm: Where information crosses to the other side 
	- left visual field from left eye to the right side
	- right visual field from right eye to the left side

####The Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of the thalamus is a key waystation for visual information
- The signals from each eye are segregated within the LGN and go into different ocular dominance columns within area V1, **layer 4**

####Primary visual cortex contains a retinotopic map
- Half of the visual cortex is representing just the middle of the visual field
- The other half for the other parts of the visual field (periphery)
- Vision is best at the fovea

####Gabor wavelets describe natural images
- Gabor functions more efficient than pixels

####V1 neurons are tuned for orientation
- V1 neurons can be modeled as Gabor functions
- Visual system is optimized to process natural scenes

####Human V1 can be modeled as motion-energy filters
- Roughly moving Gabor functions
- Simple cell neurons prefer static stimuli
- Other prefer moving stimuli
	- Speed
	- Direction
- Complex cells are composed of simple cells
	- These don't care about phase
- Predictions of the motion-energy model

####Each voxel must represent many dimensions
- Features represented within area V1:
	- X position
	- Y position
	- Eye of origin
	- Wavelength
	- Orientation
	- Direction
	- Spatial frequency: size
	- ...

####Systematic changes across the hierarchy
- Dozens of distinct areas
- Areas arranged in a hierarchical, parallel network
- Transformations between areas are nonlinear
- Areas contain systematic, high-dimensional maps
- Each area represents different visual information
- Receptive field size increases by a factor of ~4 at each stage
- Across the visual hierarchy, neurons become selective for more complex image features, and combinations of image features
- Across the hierarchy responses become more invariant for incidental features of the image:
	- lighting
	- contrast
	- spatial position
	- retinal size
	- (possibly) viewpoint
