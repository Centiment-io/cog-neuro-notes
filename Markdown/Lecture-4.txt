####Methods for recording brain activity

####Neuroanatomy
- Advantages
	- Clearly centrally important
	- Provides very rich data
	- Many different measures possible
- Disadvantages
	- No functional information (just structure)
	- Spotty/partial coverage
	- Large individual variability
	- Few noninvasive methods

####Neurology
- Advantages
	- Unique data source
	- "Natural lesion experiments"
	- Data from humans
- Disadvantages
	- "Experiment" is uncontrolled
	- Lesions may affect multiple areas
	- Difficult to interpret results
	- Difficult to generalize

#####Brain injuries have many different causes
- Stroke
- Glioma (tumors to myelin)
- Meningioma (tumors of meninges)
- Tumor
- Alzheimers

####Neurophysiology
	Utah array: 10x10 silicon electrodes
- Advantages
	- Clearly centrally important
	- Relatively easy to interpret
	- Many options for measurement
- Disadvantages
	- Small sample size
	- limited recording time
	- Usually limited to animal studies

####Optogenetics
- Advantages
	- Directly affects neuronal activity
	- Affects specific identified neurons
	- Also permits neuronal recording
- Disadvantages
	- Still a bit difficult/complicated
	- Not all neuron types accessible
	- **Only available in animal models**
