##Lecture 23

####The concept of lateralization

####The corpus callosum connects the hemispheres
- Variety of projections
	- Contraleteral
		- Homotopic
		- Heterotopic
	- Ipsilateral
- Complications: homotopic versus heterotopic connections, alternative pathways for communications (e.g., anterior and posterior commisures)

####Fiber tractography of the corpus callosum
- DTI
	- Blue: corpus callosum

####Posterior and anterior commisures
- Smaller fiber tracts
- Split brain patients
	- One of the four only nobel prizes in structural neuroscience

####Split brain patient studies and hemispheric specialization in the human brain

####Hemispheric processing in split brain patients
- **Fixation control**
- Normal brain
	- Right-hemisphere stimulus
	- Left-hemisphere processes it
	- Information sent to left-hemisphere and verbal response produced
- Partial split
- Complete split

####Hemisphere bias for local or global information
- Letters made up of little letters
- What was the small/big letter?
- Spatial frequency: a Fourier domain, property of visual stimuli
- Right: visual, left: language

####Hemispheric characteristics
- Hemispheres may be in cooperation or competition, it isn't yet clear
- Even after the split brain procedure, some functions appear to be unified (e.g., spatial orienting, attention).
- Language comprehension seems to occur in both hemispheres, **language production only on the left**.
- The left hemisphere seems to be involved in complex thought, reasoning and planning, the right seems to be more immediate and direct.
- The left hemisphere may be tuned for higher spatial frequencies (local), while the right may be tuned for lower spatial frequencies (global).
